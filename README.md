This is my current work on the configurations of games and controllers for the Dolphin VR emulator. To install thesse files, download the zip, then copy everything other than "README.md' to your "Dolphin Emulator"  folder in your documents

Currently these are the following hardware and games I've worked on:

Hardware:
- Valve Index Controllers

Games:
- [Wii/USA] Metroid Prime Trilogy 
- [Wii/USA] Wii Sports
